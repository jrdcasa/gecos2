1. Export molecule from Materials Studio. Both PDB or XSD can be used. 
    Nmols = 25

2. Use the topology library to classify and order the atoms.

    Head-Tail file :  Mol 1:  1    10    (18 atoms)
                      MOl 2: 19    28
                      MOl 3: 37    46



3. Center of mass of all molecules
