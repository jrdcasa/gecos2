GeCoS: Generation of Conformers
==============================================================

`GeCos` allows one to generate conformers of small molecules and optimize them using QM tools, such as Gaussian.
The program can be used as a CLI (command line interpreter) or through a graphical interface (GUI).

``GeCos`` is designed to setup and found the conformers using eihter rdkit or openbabel algorithms in a local computer and after the high cost QM calculations are sent to a remote (super-)computer or cluster. Both the QM package and the SLURM queue system must be in the remote system.

A typical flow chart to use Gecos is:
